How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?:
  The interpretation of user needs was handled by the Product Owner, particularly in the case of SNHU Travel through user interviews. 
  Generally, surveys, market research, and reviews, any form of feedback, will be the first stepping stone for hearing users and their needs.
  These needs are then turned into User Stories, which are then turned into test cases to be implemented, so that the user's needs are made tangible.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?:
  Developing programs should be approached in parts. An overall project will contain smaller parts that orchestrate into the full program. The list of parts is the backlog.
  The development of these backlog items can be done in sprints, the subsequent work of it being divided between the team, and progress and problems distributed during scrum meetings.
  What I'll most be taking going forward is the planning/dividing of projects into parts, and communication during the projects between the team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?:
  A good team member is one who can remain responsible to their role. 
  While the specifics differ from each team roles, generally all members are responsible for communication and their skill. 
  Communication - They can collaborate with the team, keep them updated and in the know of their progress, and keep the team's goal as a whole in mind.
  Skill - Make sure to keep up with best practices, as well as be always willing to hone their skill.
